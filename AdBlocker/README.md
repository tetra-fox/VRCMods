Literally just removes the carousels from the quick menu and more.

Supports:
- Carousel
- VRC+ Banner
- VRC+ Gift Buttons
- VRC+ Change PFP Button
- VRC+ UserInfo Supporter Button*
- VRC+ Menu Tab*

If you have VRC+ and are missing buttons, please verify that those aren't removed by the mod (ex. Change Profile Picture).

It is recommended to use UIExpansionKit from knah. You can get it [here](https://github.com/knah/VRCMods/releases/latest).

*: do not use use these options while using emmVRC and use emmVRCs own functions to disable these buttons
