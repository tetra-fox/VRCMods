Literally just removes the carousels from the quick menu and more.

Supports:
- Carousel
- VRC+ Banner
- VRC+ Gift Buttons
- VRC+ UserInfo Supporter Button **(leave off while using emmVRC)**
- VRC+ Menu Tab **(leave off while using emmVRC)**

It is recommended to use UIExpansionKit from knah. You can get it [here](https://github.com/knah/VRCMods/releases/latest).
